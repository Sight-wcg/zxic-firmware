If you want to know the use of net tools(tcpdump/telnet), please use:netdog -h tool

[TOOL]

telnet 192.168.0.1 4719            use telnet to login
top                                check CPU and memory usage
ping 114.114.114.114 [-t][-l 2000] ping specific ip, with -t will run all time without ctrl+c, 
                                     -l specify the length of the data field
ping 2000::31                      ping specific ip for ipv6
ifconfig                           list the network device already up
ifconfig -a                        list all of the network device both up and down
ifconfig xxx up|down               up or down the network device, xxx should be exist in ifconfig -a
tcpdump -i xxx [-w xxx.pcap]       use tcpdump to catch package, xxx is the network device name from ifconfig,
                                     if you want to catch package to file, you can with parameter -w xxx.pwap
tftp -pr xxx 192.168.1.100         tftp file xxx to the IP address for the 192.168.1.100 PC, PC need
                                     running tftp tool at first
iperf -c 192.168.1.100 -i 1 -w 20480 -t 9999 -p 21 client commands for iperf. -i 1 means output report for every 1 sec
                                                     -w 20480 set buffer size, -t 9999 set transmission time for iperf,
                                                     -p 21 set port.
iperf [-u] -s -i 1 -p 21           server commands for iperf. with -u will bagging with UDP, default is TCP
                                   if you want iperf from PC to device, you should running client on PC 
                                    and server on device.
ipconfig /release                  remove the dynamic IP address of the network card on PC
ipconfig /renew                    re dynamically assigned IP address for the network adapter on PC
